            "summary": "42nd President William Jefferson Clinton hung his head in shame, casted into exile, brought down so low. “It was only an affair” he would say in his head over and over. Except it wasn’t. She did not say as much, going as far to insinuate it was not consensual really put him on death's door. Even the partisan politics of the time couldn’t save him.</p>And so, Albert Arnold Gore Jr, senator of Tennessee and prominent Vice President to a popular incumbent became the United States’ 43rd commander and chief. Tasked with continuing Clinton’s legacy he starts his campaign off with the public behind him, unfortunately it won’t last long as his own skeletons are poised to come out of his own closet.</p>Meanwhile, Republican Alan Keyes looks to bring america back from the brink of debauchery, reinstalling family values and strict Christian guidelines back into the culture.</p>",

Clinton was a double-edged sword. His charisma and political prowess were undeniable, but so was the stain of the scandal. Gore's campaign recognized the need for a delicate balance, leveraging Clinton's popularity without allowing his indiscretions to overshadow their message.\n</p>Gore's firm stance on free trade posed a potential hurdle. This policy, while instrumental in fostering economic growth during the Clinton years, risked alienating blue-collar workers, especially in regions hit hard by industrial decline. With Ross Perot absent from the ballot, there was a palpable concern that these voters might be swayed toward the Republican camp.</p>\n\n",
